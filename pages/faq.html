	<h1>Questions and Answers</h1>
	<p class="question">What is this website for and who is it for?</p>
	<p class="answer">"I Want to Buy A Computer" is a website dedicated to those who quite frankly<strong> DON'T WANT TO WASTE THEIR ENTIRE DAY TRYING TO CHOOSE THEIR VERY NEXT COMPUTER.</strong> If you are a person who:
	<li>Wants the current greatest computer out there</li>
	<li>Want the best value computer that doesn't break their wallet</li>
	<li>Just wants a computer that just works</li>
	</p>
	<p class="answer">	Then this website is for you. Instead of searching through dozens of computers, IW2BAC's mission is to just give you at most 5 of the best computers available, with a personal review from yours truly as to why this should be your next computer.</p>

	<p class="question">What is CIS-425? What is the CIS program at W.P Carey, School of Business?</p>
	<p class="answer">CIS-425 is an Ecommerce class designed to help business students understand the basic structure of how a website works. Combining the skills of building a static website using HTML and CSS, we then combine other program languages such as Javascript and PHP to make the website dynamic to be used to sell items and to hold a database of registered users. This introduces students to becoming interested in building websites independently themselves or to learn more about web development langueags and frameworks such as MVC (Though I believe that we should be learning about Bootstrap and MVC in this class as well, but someday.).</p>

	<p class="question">Who are you? Who is Vincent Nguyen? And why do you still live at home?</p>
